## 🛡️ ChatWatch - WhatsApp Sticker Bot

ChatWatch is a lightweight, fun, and reactive WhatsApp bot that monitors group chats for specific "trigger words" and responds by sending a sticker and tagging the user who triggered it.

---

### 🚀 Features

* Detects offensive or predefined trigger words in real-time.
* Sends a sticker when a word is detected.
* Tags the user who triggered the bot.
* Lightweight and runs on `Node.js` using [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js).

---

### 📁 Project Structure

```
ChatWatch/
├── index.js                # Main bot logic
├── BadWordSticker.png      # Sticker to be sent
├── package.json            # Project dependencies
```

---

### 📦 Requirements

* Node.js (v18 or higher)
* A WhatsApp account (the bot mirrors a logged-in session)
* `whatsapp-web.js` and `qrcode-terminal` libraries

---

### 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repo** (or copy the code):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Takashi069s/ChatWatch.git
   cd ChatWatch
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install whatsapp-web.js qrcode-terminal
   ```

3. **Place your sticker**:

   * Add the sticker image as `<image_name>.png` in the project root.

4. **Run the bot**:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

5. **Scan the QR Code**:

   * Open WhatsApp on your phone > Linked Devices > Scan the QR displayed in terminal.

6. **Add the bot to your group**:

   * Add the WhatsApp number (from which you scanned the QR) to your desired group.

---

### ✏️ Configuration

* **Group Name Filter**:

  * The bot currently only works inside the group named accordingly in the `index.js` file:

    ```js
    if (!chat.isGroup || chat.name.toLowerCase() !== 'grpName') return;
    ```

* **Trigger Words**:

  * Defined inside `index.js`:

    ```js
    const triggerWords = [];
    ```

---

### 🤖 Example Behavior

```
👤 Someone: "Brooo what a <word> play"
🤖 ChatWatch:
  [Sticker sent]
  @9198XXXXXXX (Someone)
```

---

### 🧠 How It Works

* Listens to all messages in the group.
* Normalizes and checks message content against a word list.
* On match:

  * Sends the sticker.
  * Mentions the sender with a warning message.

---

### 📌 Notes

* The sticker must be a valid image (`.png`) in the root folder.
* The bot must stay connected (keep the terminal open).
* This is a fun, friendly bot—use responsibly ✌️
